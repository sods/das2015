<p>To expand on the popular <a href="http://opendsi.cc/datahide">Data Hide evenings</a>, we're organising a Data Science Workshop on the 16th December (the day after the December Data Hide). This extended data hide will give us a bit of time to explore and develop ideas and maybe clearer directions for Open Data Science and showcase open data science work.</p>

<p>Topics at the data@sheffield conference include an introduction to OpenML (open, networked machine learning), an example of remote sensor deployment and data collection, security in smart grids, the law and data, methods for anonymising datasets, modelling infection disease in a developed country and how to improve research software engineering, among others.</p>

<p><b>Book tickets on the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/datasheffield-tickets-19715764382">event brite booking page</a>.</b></p>

<p>The event is hosted by the <a href="http://inverseprobability.com/ods.html">Open Data Science Initiative</a>.</p> 

<p>In Sheffield we are part of an initiative to make data science more accessible to those that need to handle and understand data. We are developing a philosophy of Open Data Science which ensures access to methodologies and tools across the community of users where it is needed: in industry, clinical applications, science and the developing world. Our philosophy is to make methodologies and tools accessible through education and sharing of source code.</p>
