<p>The first data@sheffield event is to showcase ideas about open data across the University. Hosted again at the Hide, on the 16th December (the day after the December Data Hide).  We hope to be able to expand on the themes raised at the Data Hide evenings. This extended data hide will give us a bit of time to explore and develop ideas and maybe clearer directions for Open Data Science. Topics include security in smart grids, open data in Uganda, how to do machine learning on private data, and other topics.</p>
