<h3>OpenML: Open, networked machine learning</h3>

<h4>Joaquin Vanschoren</h4>

<p>Today, the ubiquity of the internet is allowing new, more scalable forms of scientific collaboration. Networked science tools allow scientists to share and organize data on a global scale, build directly on each other's data and techniques, reuse them in unforeseen ways, and mine all data to search for patterns.</p>

<p>OpenML.org is a place for researchers to analyse data together, building on shared data sets, machine learning code and prior experiments. Integrated in many machine learning environments, it helps researchers win time by automating reproducible sharing, reuse and experimentation as much as possible. It also helps scientists and students across scientific fields to explore the latest and most relevant open data sets and machine learning techniques, find out which are most useful in their work, collaborate with others online, and gain more credit for their work by making it more visible and easily reusable.</p>


<h3>Automated Detection of Malaria-Bearing Mosquitoes</h3>

<h4>Davide Zilli</h4>

<p>Abstract: Mosquitoes are responsible for over half a million deaths every year due to their capacity to vector lethal parasites and viruses, which cause diseases such as malaria, lymphatic filariasis, dengue, yellow fever and more. While they have been known to transmit malaria for over 100 years, there is still a great deal to discover about the ecology, bionomics and sometimes even the identity of many of these vector species, particularly in Asia. The HumBug project (http://humbug.ac.uk) aims to automate the detection of mosquitoes by listening to the sound of their wingbeat with cheap and ubiquitous sensors, and use this data to model their interaction with the surrounding environment. In this talk I will discuss our current challenges in gathering training data for our algorithms and the principles of the acoustic detection of their wingbeat.</p>

<h3>The Problem with Data in the Humanities</h3>

<h4>Michael J Pidd</h4>

<p>This talk will explore some of the problems of using digital data in humanities research; whether it be mining large datasets, nominal record linkage, ontology development, data visualisation, computational linguistics or simply the desire to re-use data. The talk will question the wisdom of constantly using 'bad data' and bust open the myth of 'open data'. I will draw on examples from a range of HRI Digital projects, such as Digital Panopticon which is seeking to reconstruct the lives of 90,000 criminals sentence to transportation to Australia in the 18th and 19th centuries, and Lingustic DNA which is seeking to model the evolution of key ideas (concepts and paradigms) across 30 million pages of historical printed books.</p>
