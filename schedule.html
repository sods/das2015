<h3>Ricardo Andrade Pacheco: Infectious Disease and Risk Factor Mapping</h3>

Sound and reliable information should be the foundation of
decision-making behind public health policies. To achieve this
objective, health information systems are usually dedicated to fulfill
four core functions: data generation, data compilation, data analysis
and synthesis, and communication and use. Each of this functions can
be benefited and contribute to "open data" and "open methodologies" at
different levels. An example of this is the work done at the Pulse Lab
- Kampala (PLK) in collaboration with the ministry of Health in Uganda. 

The Health Management Information System in Uganda contains rich data
on the spread of infectious disease throughout the country. Similarly,
a great deal of information about risk factors-such as climate,
population movements, geography and poverty-are available from other
sources. At PLK, we are developing new tools to extend DHIS-2, in order to
bring this information together and make it easy to visualise and
understand.

The Pulse Lab is an UN initiative that brings together experts from
academia and the public and private sectors to research and develop
ways to apply big data and real-time analytics to achieve the Global
Goals for sustainable development.

<h3>Joaquin Vanschoren:OpenML: Open, networked machine learning</h3>

Today, the ubiquity of the internet is allowing new, more scalable forms of scientific collaboration. Networked science tools allow scientists to share and organize data on a global scale, build directly on each other's data and techniques, reuse them in unforeseen ways, and mine all data to search for patterns.

OpenML.org is a place for researchers to analyse data together, building on shared data sets, machine learning code and prior experiments. Integrated in many machine learning environments, it helps researchers win time by automating reproducible sharing, reuse and experimentation as much as possible. It also helps scientists and students across scientific fields to explore the latest and most relevant open data sets and machine learning techniques, find out which are most useful in their work, collaborate with others online, and gain more credit for their work by making it more visible and easily reusable.
